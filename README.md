I am a recent graduate in engineering. I am passionate about hardware and software engineering, particularly embedded systems, networking, cloud computing, the web, and LLMs. I am able to effectively self-manage independent projects as well as collaborate as part of a team.

Previously, I worked as a software developer on an open-source internet observability platform known as Internet Health Report as part of Google Summer of Code. Before GSoC, I worked as a software engineering intern at a startup, where I solved logistics problems through code for a period of 5 months.
