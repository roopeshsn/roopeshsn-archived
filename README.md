I am passionate about hardware and software engineering, particularly embedded systems, networking, the web, and cloud-native. I can effectively self-manage independent projects as well as collaborate as part of a team.

Previously, I worked as a software developer on an open-source internet observability platform known as Internet Health Report as part of Google Summer of Code. Before GSoC, I worked as a software engineering intern at a startup, where I solved optimization problems (in the logistics domain) for a period of 5 months.
